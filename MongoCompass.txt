#You can add documents in database collection from  _MONGOSH  terminal which is present downward

On _MONGOSH terminal do the exact same thing which you were doing on terminal/command prompt.

EG:
db.friends.insertMany([
    {name:"Prashant",Location:"Society",PhoneNumber:0987654321},
    {name:"Rohan",Location:"Mansarover",PhoneNumber:0987654321},
    {name:"Sumit",Location:"Citizen Apartment",PhoneNumber:0987654321},{name:"vineet",Location:"Citizen Apartment",PhoneNumber:0987654321}
])


#you can do it directly from ADD DATA also
