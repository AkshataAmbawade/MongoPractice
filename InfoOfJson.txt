    #JSON is built on 2 structures
    *Object=> A collection of name-Value pairs
       -An object is an unordered set of name/values pairs
       -An object begines with left curly braces{ an ends with right curly braces }
       -Each name is followed by colon: and the name/values pairs are seperated by comma,
    *Array=>  An ordered list of values
              - An array begines with letf square bracket[ and ends with right square bracket]
              -Values seperated by comm.


              {
                Language
                [
                    {
                        "name":"Java",
                        "version":9.0
                    },
                    {
                        "name":"Python".
                        "version":3.0
                    }
                ]
              }

        #JSON syntax
        -Data is in name/Value pairs
        -Data is seperated by commas
        -curly braces hold object
        -square bracket hold array
