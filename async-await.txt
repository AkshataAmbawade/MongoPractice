Q.What is async/await?
-->An async function is a function declared with the async keyword, and the await keyword is permitted within it. The async and await keywords enable asynchronous, promise-based behavior to be written in a cleaner style, avoiding the need to explicitly configure promise chains




We use async-await to avoid getting promises as an output
we can't use await without async
